# C Projects

This repository contains various C code projects that I've created for fun and practice.


This is not intended to be a professional repository. These are codes I've created in my free time to learn a thing or two and for fun. 
They are not polished and are not meant to be "final products." I doubt they'll be updated once they "work," but I'll keep them in my repositories to see the evolution of my work.


## Projects

### Snake
A traditional Snake game with an interface made using GTK (reusing the library from paint.c). The twist is that if you hold the "i" key, the game will "solve" itself using BFS. This isn't optimal, and sometimes it causes the snake to lose in some silly ways, but I used this to practice data structures.
also i will add snakev2 with an optimal way to solve the game.

### Pong
A Pong game made without graphic libraries, using only ASCII characters.


### Paint
A Paint application made in C using GTK. It allows you to draw and create simple images with a friendly graphical interface.

## Notes

- Some codes may require additional libraries like gtk or configurations to compile and run.
